The Roman Empire was the post Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the 
Mediterranean Sea in Europe Africa and Asia The city of Rome was the largest city in the world circa 100 BC to circa 400 AD with Constantinople or New Rome becoming the largest 
around 500 AD and the Empires populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants or roughly 20 per cent of the worlds population at the time The 500 year old republic 
which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated 
in 44 BC Civil wars and executions continued culminating in the victory of Octavian Caesars adopted son over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the 
annexation of Egypt Octavians power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title Augustus effectively marking the 
end of the Roman Republic

 The imperial successor to the republic lasted approximately 1500 years The first two centuries of the empires existence were a period of unprecedented 
political stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana or Roman Peace Following Octavians victory The size of the empire was dramatically increased after the assassination of 
Caligula in 41 The senate briefly considered restoring the republic but the Praetorian Guard proclaimed Claudius emperor instead Under Claudius the empire invaded Britannia its 
first major expansion since Augustus after Claudius successor Nero committed suicide in 68 The empire suffered a period of brief civil wars as well as a concurrent major rebellion 
in Judea during which four different legionary generals were proclaimed emperor Vespasian emerged triumphant in 69 establishing the Flavian dynasty before being succeeded by his son 
Titus who opened the Colosseum shortly after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius His short reign was followed by the long reign of his brother Domitian who was eventually assassinated 
The senate then appointed the first of the Five Good Emperors The empire reached its greatest extent under Trajan the second in this line

 A period of increasing trouble and decline 
began with the reign of Commodus Commodus assassination in 192 triggered the Year of the Five Emperors of which Septimius Severus emerged victorious The assassination of Alexander 
Severus in 235 led to the Crisis of the Third Century in which 26 men were declared emperor by the Roman Senate over a fifty year period It was not until the reign of Diocletian 
that the empire was fully stabilized with the introduction of the Tetrarchy which saw four emperors rule the empire at once This arrangement was ultimately unsuccessful leading to 
a civil war that was finally ended by Constantine I who defeated his rivals and became the sole ruler of the empire Constantine subsequently shifted the capital to Byzantium which 
was renamed Constantinople in his honour It remained the capital of the east until its demise Constantine also adopted Christianity which later became the official state religion of 
the empire This eastern part of the empire modernly called Byzantine Empire remained one of the leading powers in the world alongside its arch-rival the Sassanid Empire which had 
inherited a centuries old Roman Persian conflict from its predecessor the Parthians Following the death of Theodosius I the last emperor to rule a united Roman Empire the dominion 
of the empire was gradually eroded by abuses of power civil wars barbarian migrations and invasions military reforms and economic depression The Sack of Rome in 410 by the Visigoths 
and again in 455 by the Vandals accelerated the Western Empire decay while the deposition of the emperor Romulus Augustulus in 476 by Odoacer is generally accepted to mark the end 
of the empire in the west However Augustulus was never recognized by his Eastern colleague and separate rule in the Western part of the empire only ceased to exist upon the death of 
Julius Nepos in 480 The Eastern Roman Empire endured for another millennium eventually falling to the Ottoman Turks in 1453

 The Roman Empire was among the most powerful economic 
cultural political and military forces in the world of its time It was one of the largest empires in world history At its height under Trajan it covered 5 million square kilometres a 
territory composed of 48 nations in the 21st century It held sway over an estimated 70 million people at that time 21 per cent of the world's entire population The longevity and vast 
extent of the empire ensured the lasting influence of Latin and Greek language culture religion inventions architecture philosophy law and forms of government on the empires descendants 
Throughout the European medieval period attempts were even made to establish successors to the Roman Empire including the Empire of Romania a Crusader state and the Holy Roman Empire 
By means of European colonialism following the Renaissance and their descendant states Greco Roman Judaeo Christian culture was exported on a worldwide scale playing a crucial role in 
the development of the modern world
